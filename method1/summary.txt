The overall model works to guide designs of engineering schemes -- like speed and tilt of the researchers' robots -- to control the collective behavior of active matter on deformable surfaces (for example, whether the robots collide on the trampoline or not).
While the results of direct interactions (like nudging) are of increasing interest and study, and the results of indirect interactions through mechanisms like vision are well-studied, researchers are still learning about indirect mechanical interactions (for example, how two rolling balls might influence each other's movement on a trampoline by indenting the trampoline's surface with their weight, thus exerting mechanical forces without touching).
When these robots were placed on a circular, trampoline-like surface, the researchers were able to monitor how the robots turned in response to the changing surface, because the robots created new dips in the surface as they moved, depressing it with their weight.In the paper, led by Shengkai Li, former Ph.D. student in the School of Physics at Georgia Tech, now a Center for the Physics of Biological Function (CPBF) fellow at Princeton University, researchers illustrated that active matter on deformable surfaces can interact with others through non-contact force -- then created a model to allow control of the collective behavior of moving objects on deformable surfaces through simple changes in the engineering of the robots.

"Our work is the first to introduce the view that an active matter system can be recast as a dynamical space-time geometry -- and thus gain an understanding of the system by borrowing the tools of Einstein's theory of general relativity," added Laguna.
In the simulation created using the researchers' spring model, the two vehicles move and merge, attracting each other indirectly through the deformation of the elastic membrane beneath, sometimes resulting in collision, just like when the team placed multiple robots on a trampoline.
Multi-robot interactions
When more robots were added to the trampoline, the researchers found that the deformations caused by each robot's weight changed their paths across the trampoline."We were excited and amused that the paths the robot took -- precessing ellipses -- looked a lot like those traced by celestial bodies like Mars and explained by Einstein's theory of General Relativity," said Goldman, of Georgia Tech Physics.
